    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>

    <p>
      Inspired by David Parker’s success with Take Back Alberta. Xander Miller
      founded Take Back Ontario in 2023. Take Back Ontario (TBO) is a grassroots
      movement focused on transferring power and responsibility from the ruling
      elite to the people of the province of Ontario.
    </p>

    <p>
      TBO is a growing network of freedom loving Ontarians from all walks of
      life who seek truth and are willing to take responsibility for their
      freedom and their family’s freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The grassroot volunteers of TBO understand that there is no freedom
      without the discipline to show up and be engaged. We proactively enable
      Ontarians to be engaged in all levels of government. The world is run by
      those who show up.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl text-red">WHAT WE DO</h2>

    <p>
      We are all about activating and empowering the grassroots of Ontario.
      Whether it’s a small gathering of like-minded friends in your garage or
      thousands in a ballroom. Take Back Ontario (TBO) is a growing voice,
      speaking truth, for freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission of TBO is to restore accountability to our democratic system
      through education that results in engagement and action.
    </p>

    <span>We do this in the following ways:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Empowering Ontarians to be proactive and engaged.</li>

      <li>Building a grassroots network of organizers.</li>

      <li>Hosting monthly meetings</li>

      <li>Providing educational speakers</li>

      <li>Discussing topical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT</h2>
    <p>
      For too long, Ontario's rent seeking elite have taken advantage of
      everyday people, thriving on political apathy, censoring those with the
      courage to speak out, and exploiting the power of big government to
      restrict our freedoms.
    </p>

    <p>Not anymore.</p>

    <p>
      It's time for everyday people to show up, take responsibility and demand
      better from our leaders, hold them accountable and, when necessary,
      replace them.
    </p>

    <p>That's what Take Back Ontario (TBO) is all about.</p>
